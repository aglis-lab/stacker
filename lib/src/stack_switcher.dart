  /// The animated transition when switching widgets is handled by a

  /// out. If `false`, both translations will in the same direction.

  /// If [transitionFirstChild] is `true`, the first child to be displayed will
  /// be built in a hidden state and transition into view.

  /// [onSwitchStart] and [onSwitchComplete] are callbacks exectued when the
  /// switch transition starts and ends, respectively.

  /// are will be maintained when the widgets are hidden. [maintainStates]
  /// and [maintainAnimations] will automatically be set to `true` if

  ///
  /// If [maintainAnimations] is `true`, the states of animations within the
  /// widgets' subtrees will be maintained when they're hidden. [maintainStates]
  /// will automatically be set to `true` if [maintainAnimations] is `true`.
  ///
  /// If [maintainStates] is `true`, the states of the widgets will be maintained
  /// when the widgets are hidden. If `false`, they will be built new each time
  /// they become visible.
  ///
  /// __Note:__ [maintainSizes], [maintainAnimations] and [maintainState] are
  /// potentially expensive operations, avoid using them if possible. Consider
  /// using a [MaintainState] widget to wrap only the widgets whose states,
